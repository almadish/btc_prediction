# Bitcoin Price Prediction using Long Short-Term Memory Model (LSTM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

## Overview
This is an individual project to predict bitcoin prices using Long Short-Term Memory Model (LSTM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The data used in the project is a historical data of bitcoin prices from January 2021 to November 2022 and can be found [here](./BTC.xxsl). The repository includes Jupyter Notebooks showing the code for both LSTM and HMM. The main PDF file including data preprocessing, analysis, and evaluation metrics used for analysis can be found [here](./project.pdf).
